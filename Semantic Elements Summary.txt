Semantics are a set of elements or tags in HTML5 that are used to 
segregate portions of a webpage or "section off content" while describing the meaning of the
element by its name. Some of the examples include <form> which is an
element for a webpage form, <table> to create a table and <img> for
image. A more expanded list includes
<article>
<aside>
<details>
<figcaption>
<figure>
<footer>
<header>
<main>
<mark>
<nav>
<section>
<summary>
<time>
Semantics can be nested within each other, and there is no
particular order in how those nestings need to be structured.
